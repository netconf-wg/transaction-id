                  Transaction ID Mechanism for NETCONF
                draft-ietf-netconf-transaction-id-latest

Abstract

   NETCONF clients and servers often need to have a synchronized view of
   the server's configuration data stores.  The volume of configuration
   data in a server may be very large, while data store changes
   typically are small when observed at typical client resynchronization
   intervals.

   Rereading the entire data store and analyzing the response for
   changes is inefficient for synchronization.  This document specifies
   an NETCONF extension that allows clients and servers to keep
   synchronized with a much smaller data exchange and without any need
   for servers to store information about the clients.

1.  Introduction

   When a NETCONF client [RFC6241] wishes to initiate a new
   configuration transaction with a NETCONF server, a frequently
   occurring use case is for the client to find out if the configuration
   has changed since the client last communicated with that server.
   Such changes could occur, for example, if another NETCONF client has
   made changes, or another system or operator made changes through
   other means than NETCONF (e.g., local configuration).

   One way of detecting a change for a client would be to retrieve the
   entire configuration from the server, then compare the result with a
   previously stored copy at the client side.  This approach is not
   popular with most NETCONF users, however, since it would often be
   very expensive in terms of communications and computation cost.

   Furthermore, even if the configuration is reported to be unchanged,
   that will not guarantee that the configuration remains unchanged when
   a client sends a subsequent change request, a few moments later.

   In order to simplify the task of tracking changes, a NETCONF server
   may implement a meta level transaction tag or timestamp for an entire
   configuration datastore or YANG subtree, and offer clients a way to
   read and compare this tag or timestamp.  If the tag or timestamp is
   unchanged, clients can avoid performing expensive operations.  Such
   tags and timestamps are referred to as a 'transaction id' (txid) in
   this document.

   Note that several server implementors have built proprietary and
   mutually incompatible mechanisms for obtaining a transaction id from
   a NETCONF server.  This document solves the interoperability issue.

   RESTCONF, [RFC8040], defines a mechanism for detecting changes in
   configuration subtrees based on Entity-Tags (ETags) and Last-Modified
   headers.  An example is depicted in Appendix B.2.2 of [RFC8040]

   In conjunction with this, RESTCONF provides a way to make
   configuration changes conditional on the server configuration being
   untouched by others.  This mechanism leverages conditional requests
   per Section 13 of [RFC9110].

   This document defines similar mechanism for NETCONF, [RFC6241], for
   config true data.  It also ties this in with YANG-Push, [RFC8641],
   and "Comparison of Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)
   Datastores", [RFC9144].  'Config false' data (operational data,
   state, and statistics) is left out of scope from this document.

   This document does not change the RESTCONF protocol in any way, and
   is carefully written to allow implementations to share much of the
   code between NETCONF and RESTCONF.  Note that the NETCONF txid
   mechanism described in this document uses XML attributes, but the
   RESTCONF mechanism relies on HTTP Headers instead, and use none of
   the XML attributes described in this document, nor JSON Metadata (see
   [RFC7952]).

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terminology defined in [RFC6241], [RFC7950],
   [RFC7952], [RFC8040], [RFC8641], and [RFC9144].

   In addition, this document defines the following terms:

   Versioned node:  A node in the instantiated YANG data tree for which
      the server maintains a transaction id (txid) value.

   Transaction-id Mechanism:  A protocol implementation that fulfills
      the principles described in the first part, NETCONF Txid Extension
      (Section 3), of this document.

   Txid:  Abbreviation of Transaction-id

   C-txid:  Client side transaction-id, i.e., a txid value maintained or
      provided by a NETCONF client.

   S-txid:  Server side transaction-id, i.e., a txid value maintained or
      sent by a NETCONF server.

   Txid History:  Temporally ordered list of txid values used by the
      server.  Allows the server to determine if a given txid occurred
      more recently than another txid.

3.  NETCONF Txid Extension

   This document describes a NETCONF extension which modifies the
   behavior of <get-config>, <get-data>, <edit-config>, <edit-data>,
   <discard-changes>, <copy-config>, <delete-config>, and <commit>
   operations such that clients are able to conditionally retrieve and
   update the configuration in a NETCONF server.

   For servers implementing YANG-Push [RFC8641], an extension for
   conveying txid updates as part of subscription updates is also
   defined.  A similar extension is also defined for servers
   implememnting "Comparison of NMDA Datastores" [RFC9144].

   Several low level mechanisms could be defined to fulfill the
   requirements for efficient client/server txid synchronization.  This
   document defines two such mechanisms, the 'etag txid' mechanism
   (Section 4.1) and the 'last-modified txid' mechanism (Section 4.2).
   However, additional txid mechanisms may be defined in the future.
   Scuh mechanisms have to adhere to the principles defined in
   Section 3.2.

   This document is divided into a two main parts; the first part
   discusses the txid mechanism in an abstract, protocol-neutral way.
   The second part, Txid Mechanisms (Section 4), then adds the protocol
   layer, and provides concrete encoding examples.

3.1.  Sample Use Cases

   The common use cases for txid mecahnisms are briefly discussed in
   this section.

   Initial configuration retrieval:  When a client initially connects to
      a server, it may be interested to acquire a current view of (parts
      of) the server's configuration.  In order to be able to
      efficiently detect changes later, it may also be interested to
      store meta level txid information for subtrees of the
      configuration.

   Subsequent configuration retrieval:  When a client needs to retrieve
      again (parts of) the server's configuration, it may be interested
      to leverage the txid metadata it has stored by requesting the
      server to prune the response so that it does not repeat
      configuration data that the client is already aware of.

   Configuration update with txid return:  When a client issues a
      transaction towards a server, it may be interested to also learn
      the new txid metadata that the server has stored for the updated
      parts of the configuration.

   Conditional configuration change:  When a client issues a transaction
      towards a server, it may specify txid metadata for the transaction
      in order to allow the server to verify that the client is up to
      date with any changes in the parts of the configuration that it is
      concerned with.  If the txid metadata in the server is different
      than the client expected, the server rejects the transaction with
      a specific error message.

   Subscribe to configuration changes with txid return:  When a client
      subscribes to configuration change updates through YANG-Push, it
      may be interested to also learn the updated txid metadata for the
      changed data trees.

3.2.  General Txid Principles

   All servers implementing a txid mechanism MUST maintain a top level
   server side txid (s-txid) metadata value for each configuration
   datastore supported by the server.  Txid mechanism implementations
   MAY also maintain txid metadata values for nodes deeper in the YANG
   data tree.  The nodes for which the server maintains txids are
   collectively referred to as the "Versioned Nodes".

   Server implementations MAY use the YANG extension statement ietf-
   netconf-txid:versioned-node to inform potential clients about which
   YANG nodes the server maintains a txid value for.  Another way to
   discover (a partial) set of Versioned Nodes is for a client to
   request the current configuration with txids.  The returned
   configuration will then have the Versioned Nodes decorated with their
   txid values.

   Regardless of whether a server declares the Versioned Nodes or not,
   the set of Versioned Nodes in the server's YANG tree MUST remain
   constant, except at system redefining events, such as software
   upgrades or entitlement installations or removals.

   The server returning txid values for the Versioned Nodes MUST ensure
   that the txid values are changed every time there has been a
   configuration change at or below the node associated with the txid
   value.  This means any update of a config true node will result in a
   new txid value for all ancestor Versioned Nodes, up to and including
   the datastore root itself.

   This also means a server MUST update the txid value for any nodes
   that change as a result of a configuration change, and their
   ancestors, regardless of source, even if the changed nodes are not
   explicitly part of the change payload.  An example of this is
   dependent data under YANG [RFC7950] "when" or "choice" statements.

   A server MUST NOT change the txid value of a versioned node unless
   the node itself or a child node of that node has been changed.  The
   server MUST NOT change any txid values due to changes in config false
   data, or any kind of metadata that the server may maintain for YANG
   data tree nodes.

3.3.  Initial Configuration Retrieval

   When a NETCONF server receives a <get-config> or <get-data> request
   (Section 3.1.1 of [RFC8526]) containing requests for txid values, and
   assuming no authorization or validation error is encountered, it
   MUST, in the reply, return txid values for all Versioned Nodes below
   the point requested by the client.

   The exact encoding varies by mechanism, but all txid mechanisms would
   have a special "txid-request" txid value (e.g., "?") which is
   guaranteed to never be used as a normal txid value.  Clients MAY use
   this special txid value associated with one or more nodes in the data
   tree to indicate to the server that they are interested in txid
   values below that point of the data tree.

      Figure 1: Initial Configuration Retrieval.  The client annotated
      the get-config request itself with the txid request value, which
      makes the server return all txid values in the entire datastore,
       that also fall within the requested subtree filter.  The most
        recent change seems to have been an update to ace R8 and R9.

      The call flow examples in this document use a 4-digit,
      monotonously increasing integer as txid.  This is convenient and
      enhances readability of the examples, but does not necessarily
      reflect a typical implementation.

   Txid values are opaque strings that uniquely identify a particular
   configuration state.  Servers are expected to know which txid values
   it has used in the recent past, and in which order they were assigned
   to configuration change transactions.  This information is known as
   the server's Txid History.

   How many historical txid values to track is up to each server
   implementor to decide, and a server MAY decide not to store any
   historical txid values at all.  The more txid values in the server's
   Txid History, the more efficient the client synchronization may be,
   as described in the coming sections.  Servers may expose a
   configuration parameter to control the history depth.  Such control
   depends on the local server capabilities.  Refer to Section 3.6.2 for
   more considerations about history size.

   Some server implementors may decide to use a monotonically increasing
   integer as the txid value or a timestamp.  Doing so obviously makes
   it very easy for the server to determine the sequence of historical
   transaction ids.

   Some server implementors may decide to use a completely different
   txid value sequence, to the point that the sequence may appear
   completely random to outside observers.  Clients MUST NOT assume or
   infer any semantic from txids.  For example, clients must not assume
   that servers use a txid value scheme that reveals information about
   the temporal sequence of txid values.

3.4.  Subsequent Configuration Retrieval

   Clients MAY request the server to return txid values in the response
   by adding one or more txid values received previously in <get-config>
   or <get-data> requests.  Txid values sent by a client are refered to
   as c-txid.

   When a client sends a c-txid value of a node that matches the
   server's s-txid value for that Versioned Node, or matches a more
   recent s-txid value in the server's Txid History, the server prunes
   (i.e., does not return) that subtree from the response.  Since the
   client already knows the txid for that part of the data tree, or a
   txid that occurred more recently, it is obviosuly already up to date
   with that part of the configuration.  Sending it again would be a
   waste of time and energy.

   Table 1 describes in detail how the client side (c-txid) and server
   side txid (s-txid) values are determined and compared when the server
   processes each data tree reply node from a get-config or get-data
   request.

   Servers MUST process each of the config true nodes as follows:

               Table 1: The Txid rules for response pruning.

   For list elements, pruning child nodes means that top-level key nodes
   MUST be included in the response, and other child nodes MUST NOT be
   included.  For containers, child nodes MUST NOT be included.

   Here follows a couple of examples of how the rules above are applied.
   See the example above (Figure 1) for the most recent server
   configuration state that the client is aware of, before this happens:

        Client                                            Server

     Figure 2: Response Pruning.  Client sends get-config request with
        known txid values.  Server prunes response where the c-txid
      matches expectations.  In this case, the server had no changes,
        and pruned the response at the earliest point offered by the
                                  client.

   In this case, the server's txid-based pruning saved a substantial
   amount of information that is already known by the client to be sent
   to and processed by the client.

   In the following example someone has made a change to the
   configuration on the server.  This server has chosen to implement a
   Txid History with up to 5 entries.  The 5 most recently used s-txid
   values on this example server are currently: 4711, 5152, 5550, 6614,
   7770 (most recent).  Then a client sends this request:

        Client                                            Server
          |                                                 |

      Figure 3: Out of band change detected.  Client sends get-config
       request with known txid values.  Server provides updates only
                        where changes have happened.

   In the example depicted in Figure 3, the server returns the acls
   container because the client supplied c-txid value (5152) differs
   from the s-txid value held by the server (6614), and 5152 is less
   recent in the server's Txid History than 6614.  The client is
   apparently unaware of the latest config developments in this part of
   the server config tree.

   The server prunes list entry acl A1 is because it has the same s-txid
   value as the c-txid supplied by the client (4711).  The server
   returns the list entry acl A2 because 5152 (specified by the client)
   is less recent than 6614 (held by the server).

   The container aces under acl A2 is returned because 5152 is less
   recent than 6614.  The server prunes ace R7 because the c-txid for
   this node is 5152 (from acl A2), and 5152 is more recent than the
   closest ancestor Versioned Node (with txid 4711).

   The server also prunes acl R8 because the server and client txids
   exactly match (5152).  Finally, acl R9 is returned because of its
   less recent c-txid value given by the client (5152, on the closest
   ancestor acl A2) than the s-txid held on the server (6614).

   In the example shown in Figure 4, the client specifies the c-txid for
   a node that the server does not maintain a s-txid for, i.e., it is
   not a Versioned Node.

          v                                                 v

        Figure 4: Versioned Nodes.  Server lookup of dscp txid gives
       4711, as closest ancestor is ace R7 with txid 4711.  Since the
      server's and client's txid match, the etag value is '=', and the
                           leaf value is pruned.

   Here, the server looks up the closest ancestor node that is a
   Versioned Node.  This particular server has chosen to keep a s-txid
   for the list entry ace R7, but not for any of its children.  Thus the
   server finds the server side s-txid value to be 4711 (from ace R7),
   which matches the client's c-txid value of 4711.

   Servers MUST NOT ever use the special txid values, txid-match, txid-
   request, txid-unknown (e.g., "=", "?", or "!") as actual txid values.

3.5.  Candidate Datastore Configuration Retrieval

   When a client retrieves the configuration from the (or a) candidate
   datastore, some of the configuration nodes may hold the same data as
   the corresponding node in the running datastore.  In such cases, the
   server MUST return the same s-txid value for nodes in the candidate
   datastore as in the running datastore.

   If a node in the candidate datastore holds different data than in the
   running datastore, the server has a choice of what to return:

   *  The server MAY return a txid-unknown value (e.g., "!").  This may
      be convenient in servers that do not know a priori what txids will
      be used in a future, possible commit of the canidate.

   *  If the txid-unknown value is not returned, the server MUST return
      the s-txid value the node will have after commit, assuming the
      client makes no further changes of the candidate datastore.  If a
      client makes further changes in the candidate datastore, the
      s-txid value MAY change.

   See the example in Candidate Datastore Transactions (Section 3.7).

3.6.  Conditional Transactions

   Conditional transactions are useful when a client is interested to
   make a configuration change, being sure that relevant parts of the
   server configuration have not changed since the client last inspected
   it.

   By supplying the latest c-txid values known to the client in its
   change requests (<edit-config>, for example), it can request the
   server to reject the transaction in case any relevant changes have
   occurred at the server that the client is not yet aware of.

   This allows a client to reliably compute and send configuration
   changes to a server without either acquiring a global datastore lock
   for a potentially extended period of time, or risk that a change from
   another client disrupts the intent in the time window between a read
   (<get-config>, for example) and write (<edit-config>, for example)
   operation.

   Clients that are also interested to know the s-txid assigned to the
   modified Versioned Nodes in the model immediately in the response
   could set a flag in the <rpc> element to request the server to return
   the new s-txid with the <ok> element.

        Client                                            Server
          |                                                 |
          |   ------------------------------------------>   |
          |   edit-config (request new txid in response)    |
          |     config (txid: 5152)                         |
          |       acls (txid: 5152)                         |
          |         acl A1 (txid: 4711)                     |
          |           aces (txid: 4711)                     |
          |             ace R1 (txid: 4711)                 |
          |               matches ipv4 protocol 6           |
          |               actions forwarding accept         |
          |                                                 |

          |   ok (txid: 7688)                               |
          v                                                 v

      Figure 5: Conditional transaction towards the Running datastore
      successfully executed.  As all the txid values specified by the
          client matched those on the server, the transaction was
                           successfully executed.

   After the above edit-config, the client might issues a get-config to
   observe the change.  It would look like this:

      Figure 6: The txids are updated on all Versioned Nodes that were
        modified themselves or have a child node that was modified.

   When a client sends in a c-txid value of a node, the server MUST
   consider it a match if the server's s-txid value is identical to the
   client, or if the server's value is found earlier in the server's
   Txid History than the value supplied by the client.

3.6.1.  Error Response on Out-of-Band Changes

   If the server rejects the transaction because one or more of the
   configuration s-txid value(s) differs from the client's expectation,
   the server MUST return at least one <rpc-error> with the following
   values:

      error-tag:      operation-failed
      error-type:     protocol
      error-severity: error

   Additionally, the error-info tag MUST contain an sx:structure
   [RFC8791] containing relevant details about one of the mismatching
   txids.  A server MAY send multiple rpc-errors when multiple txid

      Figure 7: Conditional transaction that fails a txid check.  The
          client wishes to ensure there has been no changes to the
      particular acl entry it edits, and therefore sends the c-txid it
      knows for this part of the configuration.  Since the s-txid has
        changed (out of band), the server rejects the configuration
      change request and reports an error with details about where the
                           mismatch was detected.

3.6.2.  Txid History Size Consideration

   It may be tempting for a client implementor to send only the top
   level c-txid value for the tree being edited.  In most cases, that
   would certainly work just fine.  This is a way for the client to
   request the server to go ahead with the change as long as there has
   not been any changes more recent than the client provided c-txid.

   Here the client is sending the same change as in the example above
   (Figure 5), but with only one top level c-txid value.

        Client                                            Server
          |                                                 |
          |   ------------------------------------------>   |
          |   edit-config (request new txid in response)    |
          |     config (txid: 5152)                         |
          |       acls                                      |
          |         acl A1                                  |
          |           aces                                  |
          |             ace R1                              |
          |               matches ipv4 protocol 6           |
          |               actions forwarding accept         |
          |                                                 |
          |   <------------------------------------------   |
          |   ok (txid: 7688)                               |
          v                                                 v

      Figure 8: Conditional transaction towards the Running datastore
     successfully executed.  As all the c-txid values specified by the
     client were the same or more recent in the server's Txid History,
               so the transaction was successfully executed.

   This approach works well because the top level value is inherited
   down in the child nodes and the server finds this value to either
   match exactly or be a more recent s-txid value in the server's Txid
   History.

   The only caveat is that by relying on the server's Txid History being
   long enough, the change could be rejected if the top level c-txid has
   fallen out of the server's Txid History.  Some servers may have a
   Txid History size of zero.  A client specifying a single top-level
   c-txid value towards such a server would not be able to get the
   transaction accepted.

3.7.  Candidate Datastore Transactions

   When using the (or a) Candidate datastore, the txid validation
   happens at commit time, rather than at individual edit-config or
   edit-data operations.  Clients add their c-txid attributes to the
   configuration payload the same way.  In case a client specifies
   different c-txid values for the same element in successive edit-
   config or edit-data operations, the c-txid value specified last MUST
   be used by the server at commit time.

     Figure 9: Conditional transaction towards the Candidate datastore
     successfully executed.  As all the c-txid values specified by the
     client matched those on the server at the time of the commit, the
     transaction was successfully executed.  If a client issues a get-
      config towards the candidate datastore, the server may choose to
      return the special txid-unknown value (e.g., "!") or the s-txid
      value that would be used if the candidate was committed without
       further changes (when that s-txid value is known in advance by
                                the server).

3.8.  Dependencies within Transactions

   YANG modules that contain 'when' statements referencing remote parts
   of the model will cause the s-txid to change even in parts of the
   data tree that were not modified directly.

   Let's say there is an energy-example.yang module that defines a
   mechanism for clients to request the server to measure the amount of
   energy that is consumed by a given access control rule.  The "energy-
   example" module augments the access control module as follows:

   module energy-example {
   ...

     container energy {
       leaf metering-enabled {
         type boolean;
         default false;
       }
     }

     augment /acl:acls/acl:acl {
       when /energy-example:energy/energy-example:metering-enabled;
       leaf energy-tracing {
         type boolean;
         default false;
       }
       leaf energy-consumption {
         config false;
         type uint64;
         units J;
       }
     }
   }

   This means there is a system wide switch leaf metering-enabled in
   energy-example which disables all energy measurements in the system
   when set to false, and that there is a boolean leaf energy-tracing
   that controls whether energy measurement is happening for each acl
   rule individually.

   In this example, we have an initial configuration like this:

       the energy metering-enabled leaf at the top and energy-tracing
                           leafs under each acl.

   At this point, a client updates metering-enabled to false.  This
   causes the when-expression on energy-tracing to turn false, removing
   the leaf entirely.  This counts as a configuration change, and the
   s-txid must be updated appropriately.

      Figure 11: Transaction changing a single leaf.  This leaf is the
        target of a when-statement, however, which means other leafs
         elsewhere may be indirectly modified by this change.  Such
            indirect changes will also result in s-txid changes.

   After the transaction above, the new configuration state has the
   energy-tracing leafs removed.  Every such removal or (re)introduction
   of a node counts as a configuration change from a txid perspective,
   regardless of whether the change has any net configuration change
   effect in the server.

     Figure 12: The txid for the energy subtree has changed since that
       was the target of the edit-config.  The txids of the ACLs have
       also changed since the energy-tracing leafs are now removed by
        the now false when- expression.  Both acl A1 and acl A2 have
     their txids updated, even though energy-tracing was already false
                                for acl A1.

3.9.  Other NETCONF Operations

   <discard-changes>:  The <discard-changes> operation resets the
      candidate datastore to the contents of the running datastore.  The
      server MUST ensure the txid values in the candidate datastore get
      the same txid values as in the running datastore when this
      operation runs.

   <copy-config>:  The <copy-config>` operation can be used to copy
      contents between datastores.  The server MUST ensure the txid
      values are retained and changed as if the data being copied had
      been sent in through an edit-config operation.

   <delete-config>:  The server MUST ensure the datastore txid value is
      changed, unless it was already empty.

   <commit>:  At commit, with regards to the txid values, the server
      MUST treat the contents of the candidate datastore as if any txid
      value provided by the client when updating the candidate was
      provided in a single edit-config towards the running datastore.
      If the transaction is rejected due to txid value mismatch, an rpc-
      error as described in section Conditional Transactions
      (Section 3.6) MUST be sent.

3.10.  YANG-Push Subscriptions

   A client issuing a YANG-Push establish-subscription or modify-
   subscription request towards a server that supports ietf-netconf-
   txid-yang-push.yang MAY request that the server provides updated txid
   values in YANG-Push on-change subscription updates.

   This functionality pertains only to on-change updates.  This RPC may
   also be invoked over RESTCONF or other protocols, and might therefore
   be encoded in JSON.

   To request txid values (e.g. etag), the client adds a flag in the
   request (e.g., with-etag).  The server then returns the txid (e.g.,
   etag) value in the yang-patch payload (e.g., as etag-value).

     Figure 13: A client requests a YANG-Push subscription for a given
      path with txid value included.  When the server delivers a push-
        change-update notification, the txid value pertaining to the
                         entire patch is included.

3.11.  Comparing YANG Datastores

   A client issuing an NMDA Datastore compare request towards a server
   that supports ietf-netconf-txid-nmda-compare.yang MAY request that
   the server provides updated txid values in the compare reply.
   Besides NETCONF, this RPC may also be invoked over RESTCONF or other
   protocols, and might therefore be encoded in JSON.

   To request txid values (e.g. etag), the client adds a flag in the
   request (e.g. with-etag).  The server then returns the txid (e.g.
   etag) value in the yang-patch payload (e.g. as etag-value).

   The txid value returned by the server MUST be the txid value
   pertaining to the target node in the source or target datastores that
   is the most recent.  If one of the datastores being compared is not a
   configuration datastore, the txid in the configuration datastore MUST
   be used.  If none of the datastores being compared are a
   configuration datastore, then txid values MUST NOT be returned at
   all.

   The txid to return is the one that pertains to the target node, or in
   the case of delete, the closest surviving ancestor of the target
   node.

4.  Txid Mechanisms

   This document defines two txid mechanisms:

   *  The etag attribute txid mechanism (Section 4.1)

   *  The last-modified attribute txid mechanism (Section 4.2)

   Servers implementing this specification MUST support the etag
   attribute txid mechanism and MAY support the last-modified attribute
   txid mechanism.

   Section NETCONF Txid Extension (Section 3) describes the logic that
   governs all txid mechanisms.  This section describes the mapping from
   the generic logic to specific mechanism and encoding.

   If a client uses more than one txid mechanism, such as both etag and
   last-modified in a particular message to a server, or patricular
   commit, the result is undefined.

4.1.  The ETag Attribute txid Mechanism

   The etag txid mechanism described in this section is centered around
   a meta data XML attribute called "etag".  The etag attribute is
   defined in the namespace "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0".
   The etag attribute is added to XML elements in the NETCONF payload in
   order to indicate the txid value for the YANG node represented by the
   element.

   NETCONF servers that support this extension MUST announce the
   capability "urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:txid:etag:1.0".

   The etag attribute values are opaque strings chosen freely.  They
   MUST consist of ASCII printable characters (VCHAR), except that the
   etag string MUST NOT contain space, backslash or double quotes.  The
   point of these restrictions is to make it easy to reuse
   implementations that adhere to section 2.3.1 in [RFC7232].  The
   probability SHOULD be made very low that an etag value that has been
   used historically by a server is used again by that server if the
   configuration is different.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the same etag txid values are used across all
   management interfaces (i.e.  NETCONF, RESTCONF and any other the
   server might implement), if it implements more than one.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that the etag txid has an encoding specific suffix,
   especially when it is not encoded in XML.  E.g. a response encoded in
   JSON might append "+json" at the end of the etag value.  This is in
   line with the language in [RFC7232] and traditions in the HTTP world
   at large.

   The detailed rules for when to update the etag value are described in
   Section 3.2.  These rules are chosen to be consistent with the ETag
   mechanism in RESTCONF, specifically Sections 3.4.1.2, 3.4.1.3 and
   3.5.2 of [RFC8040].

4.2.  The Last-Modified Attribute txid Mechanism

   The last-modified txid mechanism described in this section is
   centered around a meta data XML attribute called "last-modified".
   The last-modified attribute is defined in the namespace
   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0".  The last-modified
   attribute is added to XML elements in the NETCONF payload in order to
   indicate the txid value for the YANG node represented by the element.

   NETCONF servers that support this extension MUST announce the feature
   last-modified defined in ietf-netconf-txid.yang.

   The last-modified attribute values are yang:date-and-time values as
   defined in ietf-yang-types.yang, [RFC6991].

   "2022-04-01T12:34:56.123456Z" is an example of what this time stamp
   format looks like.  It is RECOMMENDED that the time stamps provided
   by the server closely match the real world clock.  Servers MUST
   ensure the timestamps provided are monotonously increasing for as
   long as the server's operation is maintained.

   It is RECOMMENDED that server implementors choose the number of
   digits of precision used for the fractional second timestamps high
   enough so that there is no risk that multiple transactions on the
   server would get the same timestamp.

   It is RECOMMENDED that the same last-modified txid values are used
   across all management interfaces (i.e.  NETCONF and any other the
   server might implement), except RESTCONF.

   RESTCONF, as defined in [RFC8040], is using a different format for
   the time stamps which is limited to one second resolution.  Server
   implementors that support the Last-Modified txid mechanism over both
   RESTCONF and other management protocols are RECOMMENDED to use Last-
   Modified timestamps that match the point in time referenced over
   RESTCONF, with the fractional seconds part added.

   The detailed rules for when to update the last-modified value are
   described in Section 3.2.  These rules are chosen to be consistent
   with the Last-Modified mechanism in RESTCONF, [RFC8040], specifically
   sections 3.4.1.1, 3.4.1.3 and 3.5.1.

4.3.  Common features to both etag and last-modified txid mechanisms

   Clients MAY add etag or last-modified attributes to zero or more
   individual elements in the get-config or get-data filter, in which
   case they pertain to the subtree(s) rooted at the element(s) with the
   attributes.

   Clients MAY also add such attributes directly to the get-config or
   get-data tags (e.g. if there is no filter), in which case it pertains
   to the txid value of the datastore root.

   Clients might wish to send a txid value that is guaranteed to never
   match a server constructed txid.  With both the etag and last-
   modified txid mechanisms, such a txid-request value is "?".

   Clients MAY add etag or last-modified attributes to the payload of
   edit-config or edit-data requests, in which case they indicate the
   client's txid value of that element.

   Clients MAY request servers that also implement YANG-Push to return
   configuration change subsription updates with etag or last-modified
   txid attributes.  The client requests this service by adding a with-
   etag or with-last-modified flag with the value 'true' to the
   subscription request or yang-push configuration.  The server MUST
   then return such txids on the YANG Patch edit tag and to the child
   elements of the value tag.  The txid attribute on the edit tag
   reflects the txid associated with the changes encoded in this edit
   section, as well as parent nodes.  Later edit sections in the same
   push-update or push-change-update may still supercede the txid value
   for some or all of the nodes in the current edit section.

   Servers returning txid values in get-config, edit-config, get-data,
   edit-data and commit operations MUST do so by adding etag and/or
   last-modified txid attributes to the data and ok tags.  When servers
   prune output due to a matching txid value, the server MUST add a
   txid-match attribute to the pruned element, and MUST set the
   attribute value to "=", and MUST NOT send any element value.

   Servers returning a txid mismatch error MUST return an rpc-error as
   defined in section Conditional Transactions (Section 3.6) with an
   error-info tag containing a txid-value-mismatch-error-info structure.

4.3.1.  Candidate Datastore

   When servers return txid values in get-config and get-data operations
   towards the candidate datastore, the txid values returned MUST adhere
   to the following rules:

   *  If the versioned node holds the same data as in the running
      datastore, the same txid value as the versioned node in running
      MUST be used.

   *  If the versioned node is different in the candidate store than in
      the running datastore, the server has a choice of what to return.
      The server MAY return the special "txid-unknown" value "!".  If
      the txid-unknown value is not returned, the server MUST return the
      txid value the versioned node will have if the client decides to
      commit the candidate datastore without further updates.

4.3.2.  Namespaces and Attribute Placement

   The txid attributes are valid on the following NETCONF tags, where
   xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" [RFC4741]
   [RFC6241], xmlns:ncds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-nmda"

   consisting of "nc" followed by a monotonously increasing integer.
   This is convenient for the reader trying to make sense of the
   examples, but is not an implementation requirement.  An etag would
   often be implemented as a "random" string of characters.

   To retrieve etag attributes across the entire NETCONF server
   configuration, a client might send:

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="1"
        xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <get-config txid:etag="?"/>
   </rpc>

   The server's reply might then be:

   <rpc-reply message-id="1"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <data txid:etag="nc5152">
       <acls xmlns=
               "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"
             txid:etag="nc5152">
         <acl txid:etag="nc4711">
           <name>A1</name>
           <aces txid:etag="nc4711">

   To retrieve etag attributes for a specific ACL using an xpath filter,
   a client might send:

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="2"
        xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">

         select="/acl:acls/acl:acl[acl:name='A1']"
         txid:etag="?"/>
     </get-config>
   </rpc>

   To retrieve etag attributes for "acls", but not for "nacm", a client
   might send:

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="3"
        xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">

           txid:etag="?"/>
         <nacm xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-acm"/>
       </filter>
     </get-config>
   </rpc>

   If the server considers "acls", "acl", "aces" and "acl" to be
   Versioned Nodes, the server's response to the request above might
   look like:

   <rpc-reply message-id="3"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"

5.2.  Configuration Response Pruning

   A NETCONF client that already knows some txid values MAY request that
   the configuration retrieval request is pruned with respect to the
   client's prior knowledge.

   To retrieve only changes for "acls" that do not have the last known
   etag txid value, a client might send:

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="6"
        xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <get-config>
       <source>
         <running/>
       </source>
       <filter>
         <acls
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"
           txid:etag="nc5152">
           <acl txid:etag="nc4711">
             <name>A1</name>
             <aces txid:etag="nc4711"/>
           </acl>
           <acl txid:etag="nc5152">
             <name>A2</name>
             <aces txid:etag="nc5152"/>
           </acl>
       </filter>
     </get-config>
   </rpc>

   Assuming the NETCONF server configuration is the same as in the
   previous rpc-reply example, the server's response to request above
   might look like:

   <rpc-reply message-id="6"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <data>
       <acls
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"
         txid:etag="="/>
     </data>
   </rpc>

   Or, if a configuration change has taken place under /acls since the
   client was last updated, the server's response may look like:

   <rpc-reply message-id="6"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"

   In case the client provides a txid value for a non-versioned node,
   the server needs to treat the node as having the same txid value as
   the closest ancestor that does have a txid value.

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="7"
        xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">

       <source>
         <running/>

         <acls
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">

   If a txid value is specified for a leaf, and the txid value matches
   (i.e. is identical to the server's txid value, or found earlier in
   the server's Txid History), the leaf value is pruned.

5.3.  Configuration Change

   A client that wishes to update the ace R1 protocol to tcp might send:

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="8">
     <edit-config xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
                  xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid=
                   "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid">
       <target>
         <running/>
       </target>
       <test-option>test-then-set</test-option>
       <ietf-netconf-txid:with-etag>true</ietf-netconf-txid:with-etag>
       <config>
         <acls
           xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"
           txid:etag="nc5152">
           <acl txid:etag="nc4711">
             <name>A1</name>
             <aces txid:etag="nc4711">
               <ace txid:etag="nc4711">
                 <matches>
                   <ipv4>
                     <protocol>6</protocol>
                   </ipv4>
                 </matches>
                 <actions>
                   <forwarding xmlns:acl=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                     acl:accept
                   <forwarding>
                 </actions>
               </ace>
             </aces>
           </acl>
         </acls>
       </config>
     </edit-config>
   </rpc>

   The server would update the protocol leaf in the running datastore,
   and return an rpc-reply as follows:

   <rpc-reply message-id="8"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <ok txid:etag="nc7688"/>
   </rpc-reply>

   A subsequent get-config request for "acls", with txid:etag="?" might
   then return:

   <rpc-reply message-id="9"

         </acl>
       </acls>
     </data>
   </rpc>

   In case the server at this point received a configuration change from
   another source, such as a CLI operator, removing ace R8 and R9 in acl
   A2, a subsequent get-config request for acls, with txid:etag="?"
   might then return:

5.4.  Conditional Configuration Change

   If a client wishes to delete acl A1 if and only if its configuration
   has not been altered since this client last synchronized its
   configuration with the server, at which point it received the etag
   "nc7688" for acl A1, regardless of any possible changes to other
   acls, it might send:

   <rpc xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0" message-id="10"
        xmlns:nc="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
        xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0"
        xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid=
          "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid">
     <edit-config>
       <target>
         <running/>
       </target>
       <test-option>test-then-set</test-option>
       <ietf-netconf-txid:with-etag>true</ietf-netconf-txid:with-etag>
       <config>
         <acls xmlns=
             "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
           <acl nc:operation="delete"
                txid:etag="nc7688">
             <name>A1</name>
           </acl>
         </acls>
       </config>
     </edit-config>
   </rpc>

   If acl A1 now has the etag txid value "nc7688", as expected by the
   client, the transaction goes through, and the server responds
   something like:

   <rpc-reply message-id="10"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <ok txid:etag="nc8008"/>
   </rpc-reply>

   A subsequent get-config request for acls, with txid:etag="?" might
   then return:

   <rpc-reply message-id="11"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <data>
       <acls
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"
         txid:etag="nc8008">
         <acl txid:etag="cli2222">
           <name>A2</name>
           <aces txid:etag="cli2222">
             <ace txid:etag="nc4711">
               <name>R7</name>
               <matches>
                 <ipv4>
                   <dscp>10</dscp>
                 </ipv4>
               </matches>
               <actions>
                 <forwarding xmlns:acl=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                   acl:accept
                 <forwarding>
               </actions>
             </ace>
           </aces>
         </acl>
       </acls>
     </data>
   </rpc>

   In case acl A1 did not have the expected etag txid value "nc7688"
   when the server processed this request, nor was the client's txid
   value found later in the server's Txid History, then the server
   rejects the transaction, and might send:

   <rpc-reply xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:acl=
               "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"

5.5.  Reading from the Candidate Datastore

   Let's assume that a get-config towards the running datastore
   currently contains the following data and txid values:

   <rpc-reply message-id="12"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <data>
       <acls
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list"
         txid:etag="nc4711">
         <acl txid:etag="nc4711">
           <name>A1</name>
           <aces txid:etag="nc4711">
             <ace txid:etag="nc4711">
               <name>R1</name>
               <matches>
                 <ipv4>
                   <protocol>17</protocol>
                 </ipv4>
               </matches>
               <actions>
                 <forwarding xmlns:acl=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                   acl:accept
                 <forwarding>
               </actions>
             </ace>
             <ace txid:etag="nc2219">
               <name>R2</name>
               <matches>
                 <ipv4>
                   <dscp>21</dscp>
                 </ipv4>
               </matches>
               <actions>
                 <forwarding xmlns:acl=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                   acl:accept
                 <forwarding>
               </actions>
             </ace>
           </aces>
         </acl>
       </acls>
     </data>
   </rpc-reply>

   A client issues discard-changes (to make the candidate datastore
   equal to the running datastore), and issues an edit-config to change
   the R1 protocol from udp (17) to tcp (6), and then executes a get-
   config with the txid-request attribute "?" set on the acl A1, the
   server might respond:

   <rpc-reply message-id="13"
              xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
              xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <data>
       <acls
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
         <acl txid:etag="!">
           <name>A1</name>
           <aces txid:etag="!">
             <ace txid:etag="!">
               <name>R1</name>
               <matches>
                 <ipv4>
                   <protocol>6</protocol>
                 </ipv4>
               </matches>
               <actions>
                 <forwarding xmlns:acl=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                   acl:accept
                 <forwarding>
               </actions>
             </ace>
             <ace txid:etag="nc2219">
               <name>R2</name>
               <matches>
                 <ipv4>
                   <dscp>21</dscp>
                 </ipv4>
               </matches>
               <actions>
                 <forwarding xmlns:acl=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                   acl:accept
                 <forwarding>
               </actions>
             </ace>
           </aces>
         </acl>
       </acls>
     </data>
   </rpc-reply>

   Here, the txid-unknown value "!" is sent by the server.  This
   particular server implementation does not know beforehand which txid
   value would be used for this versioned node after commit.  It will be
   a value different from the current corresponding txid value in the
   running datastore.

   In case the server is able to predict the txid value that would be
   used for the versioned node after commit, it could respond with that
   value instead.  Let's say the server knows the txid would be "7688"
   if the candidate datastore was committed without further changes,
   then it would respond with that value in each place where the example
   shows "!" above.

5.6.  Commit

   The client MAY request that the new etag txid value is returned as an
   attribute on the ok response for a successful commit.  The client
   requests this by adding with-etag to the commit operation.

   For example, a client might send:

   <rpc message-id="14"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
       xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid=
         "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid"
     <commit>
       <ietf-netconf-txid:with-etag>true</ietf-netconf-txid:with-etag>
     </commit>
   </rpc>

   Assuming the server accepted the transaction, it might respond:

   <rpc-reply message-id="14"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0"
       xmlns:txid="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0">
     <ok txid:etag="nc8008"/>
   </rpc-reply>

5.7.  YANG-Push

   A client MAY request that the updates for one or more YANG-Push
   subscriptions are annotated with the txid values.  The request might
   look like this:

   <netconf:rpc message-id="16"
                xmlns:netconf="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <establish-subscription
         xmlns=
           "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"
         xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push"
         xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid-yp=
           "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-txid-yang-push">
       <yp:datastore
           xmlns:ds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-datastores">
         ds:running
       </yp:datastore>
       <yp:datastore-xpath-filter
           xmlns:acl=
             "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
         /acl:acls
       </yp:datastore-xpath-filter>
       <yp:on-change/>
       <ietf-netconf-txid-yp:with-etag>
         true
       </ietf-netconf-txid-yp:with-etag>
     </establish-subscription>
   </netconf:rpc>

   A server might send a subscription update like this:

   <notification
     xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:notification:1.0"
     xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid-yp=
       "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid-yang-push">
     <eventTime>2022-04-04T06:00:24.16Z</eventTime>
     <push-change-update
         xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push">
       <id>89</id>
       <datastore-changes>
         <yang-patch>
           <patch-id>0</patch-id>
           <edit>
             <edit-id>edit1</edit-id>
             <operation>delete</operation>
             <target xmlns:acl=
               "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
               /acl:acls
             </target>
             <value>
               <acl xmlns=
                 "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-access-control-list">
                 <name>A1</name>
               </acl>
             </value>
           </edit>
           <ietf-netconf-txid-yp:etag-value>
             nc8008
           </ietf-netconf-txid-yp:etag-value>
         </yang-patch>
       </datastore-changes>
     </push-change-update>
   </notification>

   In case a client wishes to modify a previous subscription request in
   order to no longer receive YANG-Push subscription updates, the
   request might look like this:

   <rpc message-id="17"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <modify-subscription
         xmlns=
           "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-subscribed-notifications"
         xmlns:yp="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-yang-push"
         xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid-yp=
           "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-txid-yang-push">
       <id>1011</id>
       <yp:datastore
           xmlns:ds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-datastores">
         ds:running
       </yp:datastore>
       <ietf-netconf-txid-yp:with-etag>
         false
       </ietf-netconf-txid-yp:with-etag>
     </modify-subscription>
   </rpc>

5.8.  NMDA Compare

   The following example is taken from section 5 of [RFC9144].  It
   compares the difference between the operational and intended
   datastores for a subtree under "interfaces".

   In this version of the example, the client requests that txid values,
   in this case etag-values, are annotated to the result.

   <rpc message-id="101"
       xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
     <compare xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-nmda-compare"
         xmlns:ds="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-datastores"
         xmlns:ietf-netconf-txid-nmda-compare=
           "urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid-nmda-compare">
       <source>ds:operational</source>
       <target>ds:intended</target>
       <report-origin/>
       <ietf-netconf-txid-nmda-compare:with-etag>
         true
       </ietf-netconf-txid-nmda-compare:with-etag>
       <xpath-filter
           xmlns:if="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces">
         /if:interfaces
       </xpath-filter>
     </compare>
   </rpc>

   RPC reply when a difference is detected:

7.  Security Considerations

   The YANG modules specified in this document define YANG types,
   groupings, structures and additional RPC parameters for data that is
   designed to be accessed via network management protocols such as
   NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is
   the secure transport layer, and the mandatory-to-implement secure
   transport is Secure Shell (SSH) [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer
   is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is TLS
   [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   In the YANG modules published with this document, there is no
   configuration, state data, new RPCs or notifications.  This document
   defines additional XML attributes and headers, however, that merit
   consideration from a security perspective.

7.1.  NACM Access Control

   NACM, [RFC8341], access control processing happens as usual,
   independently of any txid handling, if supported by the server and
   enabled by the NACM configuration.

   It should be pointed out however, that when txid information is added
   to a reply, it may occasionally be possible for a client to deduce
   that a configuration change has happened in some part of the
   configuration to which it has no access rights.

   For example, a client may notice that the root node txid has changed
   while none of the subtrees it has access to have changed, and thereby
   conclude that someone else has made a change to some part of the
   configuration that is not acessible by the client.

7.1.1.  Hash-based Txid Algorithms

   Servers that implement NACM and choose to implement a hash-based txid
   algorithm over the configuration may reveal to a client that the
   configuration of a subtree that the client has no access to is the
   same as it was at an earlier point in time.

   For example, a client with partial access to the configuration might
   observe that the root node txid was 1234.  After a few configuration
   changes by other parties, the client may again observe that the root
   node txid is 1234.  It may then deduce that the configuration is the
   same as earlier, even in the parts of the configuration it has no
   access to.

   In some use cases, this behavior may be considered a feature, since
   it allows a security client to verify that the configuration is the
   same as expected, without transmitting or storing the actual
   configuration.

7.2.  Unchanged Configuration

   It will also be possible for clients to deduce that a configuration
   change has not happened during some period, by simply observing that
   the root node (or other subtree) txid remains unchanged.  This is
   true regardless of NACM being deployed or choice of txid algorithm.

   Again, there may be use cases where this behavior may be considered a
   feature, since it allows a security client to verify that the
   configuration is the same as expected, without transmitting or
   storing the actual configuration.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document registers the following capability identifier URN in
   the 'Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) Capability URNs'
   registry:

     urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:txid:1.0

   This document registers four XML namespace URNs in the 'IETF XML
   registry', following the format defined in [RFC3688].

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:txid:1.0

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid-yang-push

     URI: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid-nmda-compare

     Registrant Contact: The IESG.

     XML: N/A, the requested URIs are XML namespaces.

   This document registers three module names in the 'YANG Module Names'
   registry, defined in [RFC6020].

     name: ietf-netconf-txid

     prefix: ietf-netconf-txid

     namespace: urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid

9.  Changes

9.1.  Major changes in -05 since -04

   *  Corrected namespace for reference to elements in ietf-yang-push

9.2.  Major changes in -04 since -03

   *  Updated security considerations.

   *  Added several normative RFC references.

9.3.  Major changes in -03 since -02

   *  Updated language slightly regarding format of etag values, and
      some recommendations for implementors that support etags in
      multiple management protocols (NETCONF, RESTCONF, ...) and
      encodings (XML, JSON, ...).

   *  Added missing normative RFC references.

   *  Corrected the YANG-push namespace reference.

9.4.  Major changes in -02 since -01

   *  Added optional to implement Txid History concept in order to make
      the algorithm both more efficient and less verbose.  Servers may
      still choose a Txid History size of zero, which makes the server
      behavior the same as in earlier versions of this document.
      Implementations that use txids consisting of a monotonically
      increasing integer or timestamp will be able to determine the
      sequnce of transactions in the history directly, making this
      trivially simple to implement.

   *  Added extension statement versioned-node, which servers may use to
      declare which YANG tree nodes are Versioned Nodes.  This is
      entirely optional, however, but possibly useful to client
      developers.

   *  Renamed YANG feature ietf-netconf-txid:txid-last-modified to ietf-
      netconf-txid:last-modified in order to reduce redundant mentions
      of "txid".

9.5.  Major changes in -01 since -00

   *  Changed YANG-push txid mechanism to use a simple leaf rather than
      an attribute to convey txid information.  This is preferable since
      YANG-push content may be requested using other protocols than
      NETCONF and other encodings than XML.  By removing the need for
      XML attributes in this context, the mechanism becomes
      significantly more portable.

   *  Added a section and YANG module augmenting the RFC9144 NMDA
      datastore compare operation to allow request and reply with txid
      information.  This too is done with augments of plain leafs for
      maximum portability.

   *  Added note clarifying that the txid attributes used in the XML
      encoding are never used in JSON (since RESTCONF uses HTTP headers
      instead).

   *  Added note clarifying that pruning happens when client and server
      txids _match_, since the server sending information to the client
      only makes sense when the information on the client is out of
      date.

   *  Added note clarifying that this entire document is about config
      true data only.

   *  Rephrased slightly when referring to the candidate datastore to
      keep making sense in the event that private candidate datastores
      become a reality in the future.

   *  Added a note early on to more clearly lay out the structure of
      this document, with a first part about the generic mechanism part,
      and a second part about the two specific txid mechanisms.

   *  Corrected acl data model examples to conform to their YANG module.

9.6.  Major changes in draft-ietf-netconf-transaction-id-00 since -02

   *  Changed the logic around how txids are handled in the candidate
      datastore, both when reading (get-config, get-data) and writing
      (edit-config, edit-data).  Introduced a special "txid-unknown"
      value "!".

   *  Changed the logic of copy-config to be similar to edit-config.

   *  Clarified how txid values interact with when-dependencies together
      with default values.

   *  Added content to security considerations.

   *  Added a high-level example for YANG-Push subscriptions with txid.

   *  Updated language about error-info sent at txid mismatch in an
      edit-config: error-info with mismatch details MUST be sent when
      mismatch detected, and that the server can choose one of the txid
      mismatch occurrences if there is more than one.

   *  Some rewording and minor additions for clarification, based on
      mailing list feedback.

   *  Divided RFC references into normative and informative.

   *  Corrected a logic error in the second figure (figure 6) in the
      "Conditional Transactions" section

9.7.  Major changes in -02 since -01

   *  A last-modified txid mechanism has been added (back).  This
      mechanism aligns well with the Last-Modified mechanism defined in
      RESTCONF [RFC8040], but is not a carbon copy.

   *  YANG-Push functionality has been added.  This allows YANG-Push
      users to receive txid updates as part of the configuration
      updates.  This functionality comes in a separate YANG module, to
      allow implementors to cleanly keep all this functionality out.

   *  Changed name of "versioned elements".  They are now called
      "Versioned Nodes".

   *  Clarified txid behavior for transactions toward the Candidate
      datastore, and some not so common situations, such as when a
      client specifies a txid for a non-versioned node, and when there
      are when-statement dependencies across subtrees.

   *  Examples provided for the abstract mechanism level with simple
      message flow diagrams.

   *  More examples on protocol level, and with ietf-interfaces as
      example target module replaced with ietf-access-control to reduce
      confusion.

   *  Explicit list of XPaths to clearly state where etag or last-
      modified attributes may be added by clients and servers.

   *  Document introduction restructured to remove duplication between
      sections and to allow multiple (etag and last-modified) txid
      mechanisms.

   *  Moved the actual YANG module code into proper module files that
      are included in the source document.  These modules can be
      compiled as proper modules without any extraction tools.

9.8.  Major changes in -01 since -00

   *  Updated the text on numerous points in order to answer questions
      that appeared on the mailing list.

   *  Changed the document structure into a general transaction id part
      and one etag specific part.

   *  Renamed entag attribute to etag, prefix to txid, namespace to
      urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-netconf-txid.

   *  Set capability string to
      urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:txid:1.0

   *  Changed YANG module name, namespace and prefix to match names
      above.

   *  Harmonized/slightly adjusted etag value space with RFC 7232 and
      RFC 8040.

   *  Removed all text discussing etag values provided by the client
      (although this is still an interesting idea, if you ask the
      author)

   *  Clarified the etag attribute mechanism, especially when it comes
      to matching against non-versioned elements, its cascading upwards
      in the tree and secondary effects from when- and choice-
      statements.

   *  Added a mechanism for returning the server assigned etag value in
      get-config and get-data.

   *  Added section describing how the NETCONF discard-changes, copy-
      config, delete-config and commit operations work with respect to
      etags.

   *  Added IANA Considerations section.

   *  Removed all comments about open questions.
